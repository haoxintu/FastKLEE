# This file tells the LeakSanitizer (LSan)component of the AddressSanitizer (-fsanitizer=address)
# to ignore certain leaks at runtime. To tell LSan about these set the environment variable
# LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=/path/to/this/file and then run the sanitized build of KLEE.
#
# Ideally we shouldn't need to suppress anything but currently KLEE seems to be leaking
# The suppressions below are what's needed for ``make unittests`` and ``make check`` to not
# fail due to leaks.

# Ignore tcmalloc
leak:src/malloc_extension.cc
# Memory leak from klee_replay
leak:klee-replay.c
