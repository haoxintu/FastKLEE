# This test tries to check that the SMT-LIBv2 we generate when a AShrExpr is
# used is correct.
#
# FIXME: We should really pass the generated query to an SMT solver that supports
# SMT-LIBv2 and check it gives the correct answer ``unsat``. An older version of
# KLEE where AShrExpr wasn't handled correctly would give ``sat`` for this query.
#
# We could fix this if we required STP to be in the user's PATH and made available
# as a substitution in llvm-lit
